### STOPWATCH and TIMER

## Minimum Viable Product

- [x] Implemented a stopwatch that lets you start, stop and reset.
- [x] The stopwatch displays the number of seconds and milliseconds.
- [x] The timer allows a user to manually enter the time using an inputbox, in seconds.
- [x] The user is able to start, stop and reset the timer.
- [x] Toggle between the timer and the stopwatch using tabs just like the google timer.

## Stretch Goals

- [x] The stopwatch also displays the minutes and hours.
- [x] The timer also displays the minutes and hours.
- [x] The timer allows the user to input the time in seconds minutes and hours just like the Google timer.


## Final Goal

The goal of this project is to create a clone of the Google countdown timer and stopwatch.
You can see this by either searching google for "stopwatch" or visiting this link https://www.google.com/search?q=stopwatch.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
